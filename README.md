DeepTracks
==========

Every time I have a rental car with Sirius XM, I inevitably end up listening to the Deep Tracks station. However,
at home I have no Sirius XM-enabled radio, so I cannot listen to that station. I was searching the web for a playlist 
and found the text file included in this repository. So I wrote a simple Ruby script that uses the 
[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/search/) to re-construct this playlist in Spotify.
